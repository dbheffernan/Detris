===============
=: Your Game :=
===============

- What game are you planning to implement? If it is a game of your own design,
  or not especially well-known, provide a 2-3 sentence description of the game.

TETRIS!


- What classes and interfaces do you plan to create? How will the different
  components of your game (the model, the GUI, etc.) interact?

I will have a class that will keep track of that board state as well as a a class for the pieces.

- What do you think will be the most challenging thing to implement?

I think collision detection could be tricky

====================
=: Core Concept 1 :=
====================

Concept 1: ___("Appropriately modeling state using 2-D arrays or collections")____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?
Both the board state and the pieces will be represented by 2-D arrays.

- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.

As at it's heart Tetris is a grid that either has pieces present or not an array makes the most sense.

====================
=: Core Concept 2 :=
====================

Concept 2: ___(Object-oriented design using inheritance and subtyping)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?
Each individual piece will be it's own object.

- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.
Some things will be the same across all pieces, such as falling speed, but other things such as color will be different
so it makes sense to have each piece object to be a subtype of a larger piece class.

====================
=: Core Concept 3 :=
====================

Concept 3: ___(JUnit testing)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?
Collision detection will be tricky, so I'd like to do testing on it.

- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.
Since the pieces are being generated randomly it could be time consuming to do testing in game.  I'd need to
play long enough to get the percise combination of blocks and board state to test my edge cases, and I'd
prefer not to have to do that each time I want to make a change.

====================
=: Core Concept 4 :=
====================

Concept 4: ___(I/O)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?
I'd like to include funny pictures as well as the iconic music, as well as a recordable high score feature.

- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.
We did not cover sounds in class.
